## General Information
- A standalone development board for the [3DMCV7-AR](https://www.microstrain.com/inertial-sensors/3dmcv7-ar), designed for integration into robotic systems. It features dual connection options (UART or miniUSB) and includes a PCB layout optimized to minimize interference with the magnetometer.

## Setup

The board was ordered through [JLCPCB](https://www.jlcpcb.com), utilizing their stack for controlled-impedance, JLC04161H-7628. While USB 2.0 at 12 Mbps is forgiving, it's best to adhere to the specifications for optimal performance.

If you're looking to save time, you can skip the UART LED indicators without impacting core functionality.

## Usage
The board is self-powered when used with USB (preferred mode). If USB is not used, ensure that the Vin does not exceed 5V to remain within specifications. Voltage levels for the serial connection should be TTL.

## Project Status
Project is: __COMPLETE__
